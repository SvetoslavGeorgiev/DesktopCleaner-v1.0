This is my own practice project at the time I started coding.

If you got a bunch of stuffs on the desktop and you don't have time(don't want to bother with them) to sort them.
This is the easies way to do it. Just create few dicertories for your files change the path in the code and run it in VS.

Feel free to request a pull for an update or improve it!
